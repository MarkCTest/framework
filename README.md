Framework
=========

This set of files serves as examples of Ruby - Selenium automation framework elements and structure.
It's incomplete as the examples are just that, worked examples to provide insight into how we structure and use the tech to build a framework.

<b>Notes</b>
<ul>
<li>You will need to install the Gems listed in each of the <b>fw?_controler.rb</b> files</li>
<li>Each Framework example draws in more components. See the <b>fe?_environment.txt</b> file for what's needed.</li>
</ul>

<b>FW1</b><br/>
This file is a very simple, 1 file example (basicFWExample.rb), of the structure for a framework using Selenium Webdriver.

<b>FW2</b><br/>
This is the basicFWExample.rb split out into a more logical file set. Not complete but more correct.
The 5 files demonstrate that Ruby can reach out to a framework that we can now expand on.

<b>FW3</b><br/>
In progress...
